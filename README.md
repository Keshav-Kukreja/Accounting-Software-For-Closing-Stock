**Accounting Software for calculating Closing Stock**

Frontend and backend info :

I have used Python Flask to create a backend server, which serves the data from the db and json files stored in server directory.

for the frontend I have used Vue JS.


Key notes :

- Their isn't any delete option to remove companies (will be added soon).
- Modify page dosen't follow the theme of the application.
- Thier are function which aren't tested so, their might be bugs in code
- Code migh be buggy so test it in development environment.
